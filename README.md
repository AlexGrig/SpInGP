# PARALLELIZABLE SPARSE INVERSE FORMULATION GAUSSIAN PROCESSES (SPINGP)

This repository contains the code used to conduct the experiments for the paper
presented at "2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING, SEPT. 25â€“28, 2017, TOKYO, JAPAN"


## Prerequisites:

To be able to run this code one must install GPy, in particular the branch ss_sparse wich is contained in my fork of GPy.

## Running experiments:

Guidelines how to run experiments are contained in the files [experiment_1](./experiment_1.py) and [experiment_2](./experiment_2.py).
The file [experiment_3](./experiment_3.py) contains the trials of using the [Pardiso](http://www.pardiso-project.org/) library which were unsuccesful.
